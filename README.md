The government of Ontario reported that $31 billion worth of food is wasted annually. Ontarians alone generated nearly 3.6 million tonnes of food and organic waste. Best before dates are not the 
same as expiration dates which contribute to this problem. To tackle this issue, we have created a platform that connects charities to companies with good food that would otherwise be thrown out.
